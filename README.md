# DDD-TTRPG

Work in progress

## Design Philosophy

- Role-play heavy
- Story based, (but can be a dungeon crawler)
- Simple Attributes, Stats
- Progression (Attributes, Stats, Features, Itemization, Knowledge, Aspects)
- Genre independent (the core)
- Roll many dice (d20 based, Advantages/Disadvantages, Object dice)
- Easy on math
- Fail forward
- Combat is medium-fast, and dynamic
- Action economy
- Enemies are interesting (Do not hit it till die, find a way to "win" the fight)
- Ruling over Rules; Enough rules to help the GM run the game, few enough to not hinder the Player's imagination
- Everything is Conditions
- Conditions provides Advantages/Disadvantages instead of flat numbers
- Examples everywhere
- Optional Rolling Tables for fast creation
- Optional Rules for keeping past ruling consistent
- Example Bestiary, World
- Example Game
