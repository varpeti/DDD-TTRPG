# Core Rules

## Taking an Action

The Player describes or role-play what their character do.

If the **Action** can [Succeed or Fail](#success-and-failure). The GM ask you to roll a [Base Die](#base-die), the [Object Dice](#object-dice) if applicable, and the [Penalty or Bonus Dice](#penalty-and-bonus-dice) if applicable. Then add your [Attribute](character_creation.md#attributes) modifier. Tell the result. If the [Base Die](#base-die) is 1 or 20, announce it [Natural 1 or 20](#natural-1-or-20).

## Advantage and Disadvantage

**Advantage** and **Disadvantage** is expressed by their quantity. If you have one or multiple **Advantage** and one or multiple **Disadvantage**, take their difference.

- **Rolling with X Advantage**: You can chose X dice when you roll, you can chose the same die multiple times. For each chosen die roll an extra die, and take the highest result.
- **Rolling with X Disadvantage**: You can chose X dice when you roll, you can chose the same die multiple times. For each chosen die roll an extra die, and take the lowest result.

If there is multiple dice already for the same type, you don't have to differentiate them. Example: `2d4` if one of the `2d4` has Advantage roll `3d4` and take the two largest.

Bob has 5 Advantage on his next attack against the Giant Spider with his cursed Twin Dagger. He has 1 Disadvantage. Ha has a penalty die -1d4 for this roll as well. He calculates that he has 4 Advantage, and he chooses the [Base Die](#base-die) twice, one die from the [Object Die (Twin dagger 2d4)](#object-dice) and the penalty dice. He rolls:

- Base dice    :  Adv(3d20) :  1,  8, 14 -> 14
- Object dice  :  Adv( 3d4) :  1,  2,  4 ->  2, 4
- Penalty dice :  Adv(-2d4) : -2, -3     -> -2
- Result: `14 + 6 - 2 = 18`

## Natural 1 or 20

The Action you just did was exceptional, the GM should describe what extra things happen. It is not automatic [Success or Fail](#success-and-failure), instead it goes over or below the expected outcome.

## Success and Failure

Success is when the expected outcome happens. Failure when the expected outcome happens but with an unexpected turn, or the expected outcome does not happen, but something else is. It should never block the progression. Players should never try to roll for the same ting over and over again.

## Base Die

Base die is 1d20, it can be affected by [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).

## Object Dice

Object dice is [rolled](#taking-an-action alongside the [Base Die (d20)](#base-die), it is added to the roll to affect the success and usually used to for the [Damage](./conditions.md#damaged). It can be affected by [Advantage or Disadvantage](TODO)

## Penalty and Bonus Dice

Some conditions can add Penalty or Bonus die to the [roll](#taking-an-action). They should be different from the object-dice or should be rolled before/after so the result is clear.
